## Introduction

### Problem

In a micro frontends setup, one of the main problems is [cross application communication](https://dev.to/luistak/cross-micro-frontends-communication-30m3) and this library aims to solve it by providing a simple and framework agnostic API with zero configuration

### Solution

Exposing an `observable` that behaves like scoped a pub/sub topic passing events per namespaces.

This `Observable` is exported by the core package [`windowed-observable`](packages/core/REAMDE.md) with the following features:

### âœ¨ Features
- ðŸ“¦ Scoped events by `namespaces`
- ðŸŽ£ Events history retrieval with `SubscriptionOptions`
- ðŸ›¡ 100% Written in TypeScript with static types

## Packages

- [**windowed-observable**](packages/core/REAMDE.md) is a library for messaging using Observables, making it easier to communicate multiple apps or parts of an app using the window. It exposes an Observable that behaves like a scoped pub/sub topic using namespaces.

- [**react-windowed-observable**](packages/react/REAMDE.md) is a react abstraction over [`windowed-observable`](packages/core/REAMDE.md) exposing a helper that creates a scoped [`Context`](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) to handle events in a specific namespace
